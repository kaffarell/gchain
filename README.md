# gchain
Blockchain forked from the gcoin project, generalized for more use-cases (like voting, tokens, etc..).

## Todo
 - [x] Move to TransactionDev struct
 - [x] When showing info on client show status of chain (reachable or not)
 - [ ] Write more unittests
 - [ ] Implement timeslots (epochs) and mine one block per timeslot (pack all the transactions into one slot/block)
